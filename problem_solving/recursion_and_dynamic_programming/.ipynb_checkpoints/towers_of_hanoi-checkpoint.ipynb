    "In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have three towers and $N$ disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom. You have the following constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "- A disk is slid off the top of one tower and onto another.\n",
    "- A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks."
